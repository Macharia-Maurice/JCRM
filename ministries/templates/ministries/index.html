                    Ministries are the heartbeat of JCRM. They are more than just programsâ€”they are opportunities to live out your faith, build meaningful relationships, and make a lasting impact in our church and community. Through our ministries, we grow together in Christ, serve those in need, and share the love of Jesus with the world. No matter where you are in your spiritual journey, there's a ministry that's right for you.
